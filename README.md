# A python bot
A fletching bot for oldschool runescape using image detection(lmao)

Added a GUI and support for willow longbows and maple longbows, the image detection is horrible right now so I need to use tensorflow later.

Will try to make an algorithm to mimick the Brazier Curve in order to make mouse movements more human-like

This is only an expirement I'm doing to gain knowledge.

I do not condone botting, this bot will be unusable by everyone else.
