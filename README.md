# python_bot_for_osrs
A fletching bot for oldschool runescape using image detection(lmao)

Will add a gui and support for other logs later ( right now only supports willow longbow making)

Will try to make an algorithm to mimick the Brazier Curve in order to make mouse movements more human-like
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve

This is only an expirement I'm doing to gain knowledge.

I do not condone botting, this bot will be unusable by everyone else.
