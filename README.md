# A python bot
A bot for oldschool runescape using image detection(lmao)

Bot supports willow longbow and maple longbow fletching.
Bot is now finished. No it doesn't bank for you, you have to bank the longbows and get new logs yourself!

I do not condone botting, this bot will be unusable by everyone else.
