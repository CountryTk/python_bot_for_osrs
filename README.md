# python_bot_for_osrs
A fletching bot for oldschool runescape using image detection(lmao)

Will add a gui and support for other logs later ( right now only supports willow longbow making)

This is only an expirement I'm doing to gain knowledge.
I do not condone botting, this bot will be unusable by everyone else.
